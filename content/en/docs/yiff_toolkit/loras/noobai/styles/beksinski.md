## Introduction

Zdzisław Beksiński was a Polish artist whose work transcends conventional boundaries to evoke a haunting, surreal vision of dystopia. Born in 1929 in Sanok and originally trained as an architect, he turned to painting without formal art school training and developed a unique style defined by eerie landscapes, distorted figures, and decaying, otherworldly structures. His oil paintings on meticulously prepared hardboard panels are imbued with a dreamlike quality—Beksiński once stated he wished to "paint in such a manner as if \[he\] were photographing dreams." This distinctive aesthetic has now been captured by a Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for NoobAI, which has been carefully tuned to replicate his signature style, allowing AI-generated visuals to echo his grim, yet mesmerizing visions.

Over the course of his career, Beksiński evolved from expressionistic influences to a more abstract, gothic interpretation of surrealism, particularly during his "fantastic period" from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. His work from this time is celebrated for its intricate detail and oppressive atmosphere—a blend of meticulous craftsmanship and a raw, visceral imagination that continues to influence contemporary art and popular culture. This model aims to reflect the artist's technical mastery while preserving the enigmatic quality of his visions, providing a new means to create art that feels both timeless and deeply rooted in the dystopian surrealism that defined Beksiński's legacy.
